1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
If you only have 24 hours in a day,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,839
your success will depend on

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,160
how you manage the 24 hours.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,740
You should listen to me.

People are talking about Oprah Winfrey,
5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,099
Ted Turner, and Warren Buffett.

Listen to me,
6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,960
I don't care how much money you make,

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,920
you only have 24 hours a day

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,460
and the difference between Oprah and a broke person

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,519
is that Oprah uses her time wisely.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,859
Listen to me, this is why

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,000
focus well, you

have 24 hours.
12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,410
I don't care if you're broke, or were born poor.  .

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,009
I don't care if you were born rich, and

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,689
I don't care if you were in university, or

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,649
you only have 24 hours.

16
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,679
For this reason, I earned money from every side,

17
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,090
from being a high school dropout

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,979
to selling 6,000 books in less than 6 months.

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,320
What happened to the 24 hours in my day?

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,979
I was saying to myself: Well, Eric, you

need to take control of your time
21
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,700
because you're about to be broke for the rest of your life.

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,609
And this is what I would like you to do.

23
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,490
I can tell you about your entire life.

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,479
If you write down your daily schedule for me,

25
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,000
let me see it.

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,579
I will tell you what you will be in 5 years. I will tell

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,859
you where you will be in 10 years.

28
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,340
I will tell you where you will be in 20 years if you continue with the same daily schedule.

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,599
